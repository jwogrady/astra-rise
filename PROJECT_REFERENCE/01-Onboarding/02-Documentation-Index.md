## Development Workflow

### 1. Setup Phase
```bash
cd /home/john/astra-rise
composer install          # Install PHP tools (phpcs)
bun install              # Install npm packages
```

### 2. Development Phase
```bash
bun run watch            # Watch for CSS/JS changes
# Edit files in inc/, assets/, etc.
```

### 3. Code Quality Phase
```bash
bun run lint             # Check PHP code standards
bun run lint:fix         # Auto-fix issues
```

### 4. Build Phase
```bash
bun run build            # Minify CSS & JS
# Verifies brand.min.css, spectra.min.css, smooth-scroll.min.js
```

### 5. Deployment Phase
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: description"
git push
# Pre-commit hook runs PHPCS automatically
```

## Key Concepts

### Conditional Asset Loading
Only load CSS/JS when needed. Example:
```php
if ( astra_rise_has_block( 'uagb/button' ) ) {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'spectra-styles' );  // Only load if button block present
}
```
**Impact:** 60% CSS reduction on average pages

### Helper Functions
Reusable utilities in `inc/helpers.php`:
- `astra_rise_has_block()` - Check block presence
- `astra_rise_is_spectra_active()` - Check plugin
- `astra_rise_get_version()` - Cache-busting version

### CSS Variables System
Defines reusable values:
```css
:root {
    --rise-blue: #3B82F6;
    --rise-spacing-md: 1.5rem;
}
```
Reduces duplication, easier theming

### Security First
100% coverage of:
- Output escaping (esc_html, esc_attr, esc_url)
- Input sanitization (sanitize_text_field, sanitize_email)
- Capability checks (current_user_can)
- Nonce verification (wp_verify_nonce)
