## Installation (Choose One)

### Option 1: Quick Setup (JavaScript only - Recommended for beginners)
```bash
bun install          # Install JS build tools (CSS/JS minification)
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
```

### Option 2: Full Setup (JavaScript + PHP linting)
```bash
bun install          # Install JS build tools
composer install     # Install PHP linting tools
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
```

**Note:** Need Composer? See [COMPOSER_SETUP.md](./COMPOSER_SETUP.md)

### Option 3: Using npm instead of bun
```bash
npm install
npm run build        # Build CSS/JS
npm run watch        # Watch for changes
```
